# Candidate Sorting App

The Candidate Sorting App is a web application designed to assist recruiters in finding the best candidates for their company. It helps recruiters gather information about candidates from their profiles and uses a machine learning algorithm to sort and rank candidates based on their qualifications and attributes.

## Key Features

- Candidate Sorting: The app utilizes a machine learning algorithm to sort and rank candidates based on various factors such as skills, experience, and qualifications.
- Profile Information Gathering: Recruiters can easily gather information about candidates from their profiles on platforms like Codeforces, Dribbble, Kaggle, and GitHub.
- User-friendly Interface: The intuitive user interface allows recruiters to easily navigate and interact with the app, making the candidate evaluation process efficient and effective.
- Multi-role Support: Recruiters can specify the desired role(s) for which they are hiring, such as software engineer, designer, or data scientist, and the app will tailor the sorting algorithm accordingly.
- MERN Stack: The app is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing modern web applications.
